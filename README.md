# FreedomChat - Disable Chat Reporting
## **[Downloads](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/freedomchat-disable-chat-reporting.103180/)**
## The Definitive Chat Report Disabler
FreedomChat is a very simple plugin that makes player chat unreportable. FreedomChat completely disables chat reporting for 1.19+ without other negative consequences and maximum compatibility. FreedomChat is better than the competition.

## Installation
Installing this plugin is very simple. Just download it and put it in your plugins folder. There is no configuration, it is always active.

If you get an error when the plugin is enabling, you have likely downloaded the wrong version! Each Minecraft version has its own plugin version.

## Comparison

Unlike NoEncryption, FreedomChat does not create invalid chat packets. NoEncryption will cause a large and visible warning to players on 1.19.1. FreedomChat will not do this.

Unlike NoChatReports, FreedomChat will not break chat plugins. NoChatReports will completely break any chat plugin, by design. It must manually add compatibility for every plugin modifying chat. FreedomChat requires no such work, and will work out of the box with every chat plugin.
